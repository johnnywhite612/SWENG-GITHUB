The aim of my project was to provide data visualisation of an aspect of the software engineering process. I took the angle of building a web app which recruiters can use to find developers in the same location as their company.

- Once you search a location a list of developers will come up (a sample of 50 is taken)
- Filter developers by programming language (optional)
- Select a developer, view their profile and observe some insights on the performance as a developer
- To do this i scraped their public repos (which weren't a fork), and collated data from them all.

## About

I developed this project using Node js, React js, React Router, Victory Data-Visualisation tool, and a few other misc tools. Please see code base for more details.
